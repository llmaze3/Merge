# Merge Sort Algorithm
A program to display the merge sort algorithm (divide and conquer approach)

# What I learned
- Initialization: All of the arrays start at 0 in the beginning. 
- Maintenance: If the L[i]<=R[j] is true then L[i] is ths smallest element not into A[]. Incrementing k and i maintains loop invariant. 
- Termination: All of the largest elements have been copued into A[]
- Time Complexity: O(nlogn) Better than insertion sort as the size of the array increases.

# How To Compile In MacOS Terminal

- To compile type: javac MergeSort.java
- To execute type: java MergeSort
